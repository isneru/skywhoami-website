    <p>
      i've been writing code since i was 9 (questionable parenting, if you ask
      me).
    </p>
    <p>
      i make tools, systems, and setups that help me do things better. stuff
      thats weird, overengineered, or just fun to mess with.
    </p>
    <p>i learn by doing, breaking things, and keeping it mine.</p>
    <p>
      outside of programming, you'll probably find me listening to music,
      playing games, tinkering with my setup, or just getting lost in some
      rabbit hole online.
